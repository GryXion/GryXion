- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything i can
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing right now, i decided to focus on my learning curve with private projects (submarines to explore the marianne pit easely all years around, rovers and other transportation systèmes on mars, comunication devices with much less communications delay between planetes than light speed offer)
- 📫 How to reach me : a new e-mail adresse will be create en checked by me on a each week bases as no collaborating projects are ongoing.
